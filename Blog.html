<h2>This Is My First Article</h2>

<p class="first">Let's have a nice tree right here. Trees grow however makes them happy. I'm going to mix up a little color. We’ll use Van Dyke Brown, Permanent Red, and a little bit of Prussian Blue.</p>

<p>When you do it your way you can go anywhere you choose. There we go. There is immense joy in just watching - watching all the little creatures in nature.</p>

<p>Clouds are free. They just float around the sky all day and have fun. It all happens automatically. You don't have to spend all your time thinking about what you're doing, you just let it happen. Get tough with it, get strong. You can do it. You don't want to kill all your dark areas they are very important.</p>

<h2>This Is My Second Article</h2>

<p class="first">Just pretend you are a whisper floating across a mountain. Nice little fluffy clouds laying around in the sky being lazy. All you have to learn here is how to have fun. There's nothing wrong with having a tree as a friend. In your imagination you can go anywhere you want. I think there's an artist hidden in the bottom of every single one of us.</p>

<p>It's important to me that you're happy. Van Dyke Brown is a very nice brown, it's almost like a chocolate brown. I like to beat the brush.</p>

<p>Let's put some highlights on these little trees. The sun wouldn't forget them. All you need to paint is a few tools, a little instruction, and a vision in your mind. That's what painting is all about. It should make you feel good when you paint. We tell people sometimes: we're like drug dealers, come into town and get everybody absolutely addicted to painting. It doesn't take much to get you addicted. It's a very cold picture, I may have to go get my coat. It’s about to freeze me to death. Here we're limited by the time we have.</p>
